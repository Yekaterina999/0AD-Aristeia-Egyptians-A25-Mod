    <History>Contrary to what is often assumed, Egypt actually possessed chariots before the Hyksos made use of them, although it is probable that the early New Kingdom Pharaohs made use of a good number of captured Hyksos horses and equipment at first. Egyptian chariots, especially later on, were much more maneuverable than those of many of their foes, particularly the Hittites.</History>
