# 0AD-Aristeia-Egyptians-A25-Mod
Bronze Age Mod for A25, pulled from Aristeia

The original Aristeia mod was incompatible with A25, so I decided to extract the civs from there and make them into separate, smaller mods which are compatible with A25. 
In this mod I added the Bronze-Age Egyptians, or the 15th Dynasty of Egypt. 

Feel free to test and report any bugs!
